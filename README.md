## What Gearslip is

Gearslip is an Android Auto client for the phone. It speaks the Android Auto protocol
directly to a car head unit over USB, with no Google software in the path. Gearslip acts
as a Car App Library host: an app that ships a car interface hands Gearslip a template,
and Gearslip renders that template natively on the car screen. Nothing is mirrored from
the phone. For apps without a car interface, Gearslip offers a separate screen-sharing
mode.

## Features

- **Phone calls.** Dial from a keypad, or search your contacts, then confirm before the
  call goes out.
- **Navigation.** Gearslip hosts real Car App Library map apps on the car screen.
  Organic Maps, OsmAnd, and Flitsmeister work today. Vela runs, with rough
  edges.
- **Music.** Browse, play, and queue tracks from a car-enabled media app, with a Now
  Playing view, an Up Next queue, and lyrics. Type a search, and apps that accept one
  play the best match.
- **The web.** A browser template with its own on-screen keyboard, for anything that
  doesn't ship a car interface of its own.
- **Weather and the day ahead.** A dashboard screen shows the week's calendar next to
  the current and coming weather.
- **Messages.** New messages appear as a small card on the car screen. Gearslip reads
  each one aloud, and you reply by voice or with a quick reply. Music pauses while
  Gearslip speaks or listens. Speech runs on the phone, so it needs no Google account.
- **Notifications.** Only messages, missed calls, alarms, and reminders interrupt you.
  The rest wait on the dashboard.
- **Your apps, your order.** The launcher groups apps by kind: phone, maps, music,
  messaging, and the rest. Press and hold an app to move it.
- **Car controls.** Steering wheel buttons, control knobs, and D-pads all work.
- **Themes.** Choose flat buttons or skeuomorphic ones that look like real keys.

## Status

- **The connection is wired only, for now.** Plug the phone into the head unit's USB port;
  Gearslip does not yet offer a wireless option.
- **Setup walks you through it.** First launch asks for the Android Auto certificate,
  then one permission at a time, each with a plain reason and an Allow or Skip. A help
  screen inside the car answers anything setup didn't cover.
- **Templated apps work.** Gearslip renders all 16 template types that the Car App
  Library defines, and it draws its own keyboard for search, sign-in, and text fields.
  It has been tested against several real navigation and media apps.
- **Gearslip works with [LIVI](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI),** the open-source head unit
  used in homemade car dashboards.
- **Some apps refuse Gearslip.** Spotify, Waze, and Google Messages use a version of
  Google's car library that accepts only Android Auto itself. Spotify still plays through
  Gearslip's own player.
- **Most cars work.** Starting in 2020, some cars added newer security standards that
  reject Gearslip's certificate, and Gearslip can't run in those cars.
- **Calls use the car's Bluetooth,** as they do in Android Auto. Pair the phone with the
  car to hear calls through its speakers.
- **Audio reaches the car by capturing playback, not by mirroring the screen.** Android
  shows a screen-share consent dialog for this, even though Gearslip never reads the
  screen; it is the only way an ordinary app can capture another app's audio. The dialog
  appears once per drive.
- **Gearslip needs no adb, root, or Shizuku.** Every feature relies on an ordinary
  Android permission or an on-device consent dialog. The setup guide offers two optional
  adb commands: one removes the audio dialog for good, and the other keeps notifications
  visible while audio plays.

## Usage notes

Gearslip can send short notes that show which cars it works in. They stay off unless you
turn them on, in setup or in Settings.

- **When they go out.** When you open Gearslip, at most once a day, and after each drive.
  Nothing runs in the background.
- **What they carry.** The Gearslip version, plus whatever you tick: the Android version
  and whether the phone runs GrapheneOS, the phone model, whether a car connected that
  day, and each car's head unit, model, year, screen size, and connection result.
  Settings shows the exact note.
- **What they leave out.** Your name, accounts, location, contacts, messages, and
  anything you type or play.
- **How phones are counted.** A random number counts each phone once. The server keeps
  only a salted hash of it.
- **Where they go.** To a Cloudflare Worker, whose code is in
  [stats-worker/](stats-worker/). Cloudflare sees your IP address in delivering a note,
  as it would for any website; the Worker doesn't store it.

Turn the notes off, and they stop at once.

## Building

```
./gradlew :gearslip:assembleDebug
```

The APK lands at `build/Gearslip-debug.apk`.

A release build needs a signing key. Copy `keystore.properties.example` to
`keystore.properties`, fill in your own values, and run
`./gradlew :gearslip:assembleRelease`. Git ignores both the properties file and the
keystore. Without them, the debug build still works.

## Writing apps for Gearslip

[docs/BUILDING_APPS.md](docs/BUILDING_APPS.md) specifies how to write apps that Gearslip
can render: templated apps, media apps, and the Gearslip app protocol.
