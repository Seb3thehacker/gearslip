/**
 * Debug-only stand-in for the head unit's media audio sink.
 *
 * The car end of the audio path can only be exercised in a car, but everything before it - the
 * setting, the consent dialog, the capture service, and whether the media app allows itself to be
 * heard at all - is phone-side and can be tested at a desk. This sink takes the place of
 * [AudioLink] so that path runs to completion, and reports what arrived.
 *
 *   adb shell am start -n app.seb3thehacker.gearslip/.CarPreviewActivity \
 *       --ei w 800 --ei h 480 --ez audio true --ei snaps 10
 *
 * A healthy run logs a rising byte count and a peak well above zero. A byte count that rises with
 * a peak of zero means the app refused to be captured.
