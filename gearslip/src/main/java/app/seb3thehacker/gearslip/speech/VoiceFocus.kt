/**
 * Pauses the music while Gearslip talks or listens. Without it the microphone heard the song and
 * Whisper wrote down lyrics, and a message read aloud had to compete with the music.
 *
 * Transient exclusive focus makes music apps pause rather than duck, and they resume on their
 * own once it's given back. The release waits a moment, so a read-aloud message followed by
 * "Do you want to reply?" and the microphone is one pause, not three.
