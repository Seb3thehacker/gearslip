/**
 * Replays head-unit touches onto the phone while [PhoneMirror] is running.
 *
 * dispatchGesture is the only public API that lets one app inject input into another, which
 * is why mirroring needs an accessibility service at all. Gearslip subscribes to no event
 * types and never inspects a window, so nothing about the phone's screen is read here - the
 * service is a one-way output.
 *
 * A head unit sends a stream of DOWN/MOVE/UP, but a gesture is dispatched as a whole path, so
 * the two are bridged with continued strokes: each dispatch carries the movement since the
 * last one, and the next is only queued once the previous completes. Moves that arrive while
 * a segment is in flight collapse into the most recent point, which keeps the replayed path
 * tracking the finger instead of falling behind it.
