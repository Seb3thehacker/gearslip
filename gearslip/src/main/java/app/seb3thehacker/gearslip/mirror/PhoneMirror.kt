/**
 * Mirrors the phone's screen into the head unit's video stream.
 *
 * The platform will not let a normal app render another app onto a display it owns (an
 * activity may only be placed on a virtual display whose owner shares its uid, and doing it
 * for someone else's app needs INTERNAL_SYSTEM_WINDOW - see ScreenProjector.launchApp).
 * Mirroring sidesteps that: the app runs where it always does, on the phone's own display,
 * and MediaProjection copies that display into the encoder Surface we are already feeding to
 * the car. Touch makes the return trip through [TouchRelayService].
 *
 * The MediaProjection token is produced by [MirrorService], because Android only hands one
 * over while a foreground service of type mediaProjection is running.
