 * willing to stream; [SensorType] names the ones publicly documented by other AA reverse-engineering
 * projects (aasdk, openauto). That mapping is carried over from other projects, not verified
 * against this exact unit, so it's a label, not a guarantee - the raw field dump next to it is
 * the ground truth. Once [onEvent] starts decoding real traffic from the 2018 Uconnect, correct
