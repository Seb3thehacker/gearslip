/**
 * Sees every incoming call before it rings, so the car screen can show who is calling and
 * decline it in the same window a spam-blocker would use. Inert until the driver sets Gearslip
 * as the phone's caller ID and spam app - the same on-device consent Truecaller-style apps ask
 * for, not a privileged permission.
 *
 * The system gives an app a few seconds to answer before it lets the call ring on its own, so a
 * response is sent either when the driver taps a button or when that window is about to close,
 * whichever comes first. Answering a call that has already passed this point still works, since
 * [CarCalls.answer] goes through the ordinary ringing-call API rather than through screening.
