/**
 * Joins the two ends of the audio path: [AudioCaptureService] on the phone, which hears what the
 * phone is playing, and the car's audio channel, which is where it has to end up.
 *
 * Capture belongs to the car session, not to any one app. Android grants it through a consent
 * dialog that cannot be answered in advance or remembered, so Gearslip asks once, when a head unit
 * first offers a sink to play through, and then holds that grant for as long as the car is
 * connected. Switching between media apps, or starting playback from the phone, costs nothing
 * further: the capture is by audio usage rather than by app, so whatever the phone plays as media
 * goes to the car.
