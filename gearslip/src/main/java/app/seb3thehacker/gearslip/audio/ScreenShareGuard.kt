/**
 * Keeps the phone's notifications readable while audio is being sent to the car.
 *
 * Playback capture hangs off a MediaProjection, and since Android 15 any full-screen projection
 * makes SystemUI hide notification contents, on the assumption that someone is watching the
 * screen. Nobody is: the audio projection never makes a display. The one exemption an ordinary app
 * can reach is the developer setting that switches the protection off, so Gearslip turns it off for
 * the length of the capture and back on afterwards.
 *
 * Writing it needs WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS, granted once over adb. Without the grant this does
 * nothing and notifications stay hidden while music plays, which is the platform's default.
 *
 * Phone mirroring deliberately does not use this: there the screen really is being shown.
