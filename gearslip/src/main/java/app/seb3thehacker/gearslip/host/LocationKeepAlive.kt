/**
 * Lets a hosted navigation app keep receiving the phone's location while Gearslip is not on screen.
 *
 * Android only gives an app location in the background if something visible to the user is
 * running for it. A nav app bound as a car app has nothing of its own showing, so it goes
 * without a fix as soon as the phone screen leaves it. Binding with BIND_INCLUDE_CAPABILITIES
 * lends it this service's location capability, which is why this foreground service exists.
 * It needs the ordinary location permission, granted on the phone.
